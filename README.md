Whack A Meng
============

What-A-Mole style mini-game centred around characters from the MMORPG [Here Be Monsters](http://apps.facebook.com/herebemonsters).

For those unfamiliar with **Here Be Monsters**, the protagonist is `Meng the Terrible`, a baddie from the Nanjing storyline. 

Your task is simple - whack him whenever he pokes his head out of the rabbit hole!

To progress through each level you need to whack **Meng** at least the required number of times before the time runs out. Other monsters will occassionally pass by the scene, if you whack one of them by mistake (or just being naughty!) then your score will be deducted each time, so better watch out!
